# RayTracing-Project
CPU based ray tracer written with a custom math library. 
This project was written within 8 weeks by me.

There are three projects which are:
- The ray tracing application
- The custom math library with vectors & matrices
- The unit test project for testing custom math functions

I advise to build and run the project in 64x release mode.

The controls are:
- WASD to move the camera
- Z and X to rotate the camera left or right
- R and F to move the camera up or down
- Q to quit the application
